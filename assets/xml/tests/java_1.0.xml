		Hi!
		
		You're about to take our Java test! It's not a super long test, but Java's a big langauge so we cover a lot of different topics.
		
		Don't worry; we're not going to make any decisions based on this test alone. It just gives us a way to get an idea how much Java you know so we can make the best decision about where you might fit in our company.
		
		Please take careful note of the grading guidelines. They are available to look at any time.
		The important thing to remember is that while you want to answer as many questions as you can, if you really don't know, that's fine. Just leave it blank and it won't count against you.
